ok, now that everything is supposly working with my new website we need to talk about the architecture 
cause it is very bad as it is now.
as I said before I would like a website that will hold my articals
basically it should me like a blog
with potential expention

I do want to have a langusage switch and a theme switch as it is working now
BUT now I see how it is build and it look like it was build by a non proffesional being
first it clearly have a mixed files of content (the articals) within html and with js
this is not the way to build somthing maintainable

now maybe the github pages is not the right place to build what I am looking for
what do you say?
