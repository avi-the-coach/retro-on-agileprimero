I am writing this cause it is easier to write here a longer prompt
once you read this you can delete it

the design I wish for the web site is as follow:
1 - black and white
the whole website should have 2 optional themes
black or dark
in this theme the whole background is black and writing is white
also the griffin logo is white
in the light theme the background is white and all writing is black and also logo is black griffin
the site start with dark theme
on all pages there is a switch theme button
when the theme is dark the switch is with white background and icon of a sun
when clicked the theme change to light and the button is becoming with moon icon and black bacground


2 - hebrew and english
another swich we have is the language
starting with hebrew where everithing is RTL
we have English button
when clicked all page switch to english and page become LTR

magor issue is that the logo also swich file
we have 4 files to match 
1 = dark theme - hebrew
2 = dark theme - english
3 = light theme - hebrew
4 = light theme - english

now I would like you to revise the whole structure of the site and come up with a smart design to hendle all this without the need to 
go over all pages to change somthing in the styles
obviusly some level of change will require go over all
but I would like you to come with a smart solution
